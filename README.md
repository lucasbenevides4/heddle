# About project


This is a solution to the challenge [Huddle landing page with unique introductory section on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0).

The project consists of creating a detailed Dev page similar to that proposed by the challenge, creating the web model and the mobile model.
